Init containers

An initContainer is configured in a pod like all other containers, except that
it is specified inside a initContainers section.
When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the
initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the
application starts.
You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for
multi-pod containers. In that case each init container is run one at a time in
sequential order.
